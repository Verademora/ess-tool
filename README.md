# Oblivion Save Tool
Highly unfinished and developmental tool for parsing and potentially editing save files for *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion*. Currently if you run this crate with an oblivion save file in the root directory named "test.ess", the program will output details about the save and save a copy of the save image as a PNG to the root directory. I might tinker with this and I'm not looking for any contributions. If you find anything useful in this crate you can fork it or copy what i've done and use it. I don't see anyone using any of this code but if someone does, credit is appreciated.
